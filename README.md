Viraan is an ecosystem that generates employment and combats waste management and segregation at its core. The eco system consists of users, vendors, NGOs and volunteers. We have built an app, Viraan, which facilitates the selling of segregated waste from user. The users sell their waste via our app, volunteers collect the waste and sell it to vendors for proper waste management for eg, plastic to recycling unit. The NGOs are part of our business model as they offer education and free meals to the children of our volunteers, which encourages them to work in our ecosystem and in return we publish offers by the patrons of the NGOs on our app.

## Tech Stack
- Figma: The UI/UX design is being created on figma. 
- Flutter: The app is being developed over flutter.
- Machine Learning: The model to segregate waste is VGG16. 

## Idea behind Viraan
- We are making a flutter app called Viraan, through which users can scan their waste and know what type of waste it is (types of waste: plastic, metal, glass, kitchen waste, paper and Non Biodegradable , Biodegradable) and can even sell their waste through the app 
- The users get coins on selling their waste which can be later redeemed to avail rewards through our app
- We have created an ecosystem of 4 primary elements: users, volunteers, Vendors and NGO
- Users can sell their waste through our app(segregated waste will be sold), which will be collected by our volunteers (who are below poverty line citizens), who will then sell it to the Vendors selected by us(or, company), the company will be in partnership with NGOs who provide free meals and education to the children of our volunteers.
- The volunteers earn 80% of the revenue generated by selling the total waste each day.

## Social Problems Viraan solves
We are trying to solve the following social problems
- Waste Management
- Waste Segregation
- Hunger Disparity 
- Child Labor
- Urban Unemployment

## Use Cases
1. The app could be used by people who want to follow a zero waste lifestyle 
2. The app has an interactive ML model which can be used by kids to educate them about various types of waste and sensitize them about proper waste management guidelines
3. The app can be employed by companies to segregate their waste and this data can be used by HR teams to better manage waste produced by companies.
4. The NGOs can benefit from the ecosystem as they get to know about vulnerable people of society and hence can be used towards the betterment of those vulnerable people.

## Future Scope
1. The app can be deployed on a large scale to combat the societal issues aforementioned.
2. In future we can also incorporate tracking of the volunteerâ€™s route for picking and delivery of waste and the routes can be optimized for less fuel consumption and a greener route for less carbon footprint
